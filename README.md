# slc-air-quality-example
This is the code used in my published Alexa app - Salt Lake City Air Quality. Salt Lake City has horrible air quality in the winter months. This is a free Alexa app I published earlier this year to help solve a personal itch of mine - finding the air quality before I step outside. Checking on my phone was time consuming, but I had an Alexa. So, I wrote this Alexa skill in an evening.

Feel free to use this as a template for your own Alexa skill designs.
